# MachineLearningFromHand

A collection of few **machine learning algorithms** implemented from scratch, no `scikit-learn`, just Numpy and math. 
Built by `criticalfernet` as a learning exercise.


## Why “From Hand”?

This repo is created to understand ML algorithms by recreating them in pure Python. 
As of the latest commit, the project structure includes modules for clustering, classification, regression, and neural networks.


**The `shell.nix` file defines reproducible environment with Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib.**
